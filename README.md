```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/insert -d '{"database": "my_database", "data": {"key": "value"}}'
```

### Retrieving Data

To retrieve data, send a GET request to the `/retrieve` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/retrieve?database=my_database
```

### Deleting Data

To delete data, use the `/delete` endpoint:
