<p>To change the, ip, and port, you must change the host's values to change the ip in db.py, and you must change the port value to change the port in db.py, run db.py to activate the db.</p>
<p>To use this curl the url with the ip, and port, then add the comand and /, and after that add the content(no spaces) you want to do to the data base.</p>
<p>How you can help is by forking this repo to make your own better databases.</p>
<p>This database was made in a day.</p>
<p>This was built in python 3.11.</p>
<p>The data goes into db.txt.</p>
<p>Data gets overwritten by the data you add.</p>
